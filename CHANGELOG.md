### 3.0.0 / ????-??-?? ###

* BREAKING: Drop support for EOL'd Ruby 2.x
* Prevent duplicate assembly steps [#49](https://github.com/transloadit/ruby-sdk/issues/27) (@ifedapoolarewaju)
* Send "Transloadit-Client" header for every request (@ifedapoolarewaju)

### 2.0.1 / 2017-01-23 ###

* Use the ssl enabled url as the API base url (@ifedapoolarewaju)

### 2.0.0 / 2016-12-03 ###

* Drop support for EOL'd Ruby 1.9.x and Ruby 2.0, please use version 1.2.0 if you need support for older
  Ruby versions.
* Fix compatibility to Ruby >=2.1 and Rails 5.
* Remove bored instance logic (thanks @ifedapoolarewaju for the PR). This shouldn't affect users at all and removes
  the need for another HTTP request before the actual HTTP request.
* We now have the `transloadit.bill` method to retrieve billing reports. (@ifedapoolarewaju)
* Deprecate `assembly.submit!` method for `assembly.create!`. This shouldn't affect users as the `submit!` method remains
  as an alias for `create!`. (@ifedapoolarewaju)
* Add support for new `assembly` methods (Thanks @ifedapoolarewaju):
  * list to get a list of all assemblies.
  * get to retrieve a particular assembly. Requires assembly id to be passed as argument.
  * replay to replay a particular assembly. Requires assembly id to be passed as argument.
  * get_notifications to get a list of all assembly notifications.
  * replay_notification to replay the notification of a particular assembly. Requires assembly id to be passed as argument.
* We now have a Template api with the following methods:
  * create to create a new template.
  * list to get a list of all templates.
  * get to retrieve a particular template.
  * update to update a particular template.
  * delete to delete a particular template.
* Add rate limit feature to implicitly retry assembly creation when the rate limit is reached.
* Add `assembly.reload_until_finished!` which calls `reload!` once per second until assembly is finished (@gbuesing)
* Added example files with a [small tutorial](examples/README.md) in `examples` (@jasonaibrahim)
